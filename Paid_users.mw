Users with access to paid resources have some extra flags and a tool for monitoring their nodes.

==Jobscript additions==

For a job to be eligible to run on your nodes, you will need to specify your project in your jobscript:

<code>
 # Specify project
 #$ -P <project>
</code>

This will allow a job to run on your nodes, but it can also be scheduled on general-use nodes if some are available first. This should be the main way you run jobs.

If you need to, you can force jobs to run on your nodes only. This is suitable when you have arranged policies on your nodes that are different from the normal policies, as it allows you to override them.

<code>
 # Specify paid flag to force running on your nodes only, with your policies
 #$ -l paid=1
</code>

==Check what is running on your nodes==

We have a <code>whatsonmynode</code> script that does a <code>qhost -j</code> on each of the nodes belonging to your project, so you can see which nodes you have, what is running on them and from which user.

<code>
 module load userscripts
 whatsonmynode <project>
</code>

==Nodetypes==

Legion nodes are now named beginning with node-[pqstuvxyz] so you can tell the nodetype from the name. The standard option for paid nodes is type U - the exact hardware varies over time as newer ones are bought, so U nodes are similar rather than identical.

==Backfill==

In our usual arrangement, paid nodes are available for backfill from other users when you have not been using them. The policy is set by the CRAG: this is the current policy as of November 2015. 

* When you have not run a job on an individual node for 48hrs, then it becomes available for general use jobs of up to 12hrs. 
* When you submit a new job, the queues will not allow any other general use jobs on to your nodes, but the ones currently running will complete. 
The maximum wait time for your job is hence 12hrs.

Other options may be discussed at time of purchase if this is not suitable.

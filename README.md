# Research Computing Docs

This is documentation for the RITS Research Computing services,
to be rendered into a website using Jekyll and templating using
a mechanism found elsewhere (not yet implemented but probably
to be in another repo, which should be linked here when someone
remembers).

It is automatically linted using [MDL](https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint)
after each commit using [Travis](http://travis-ci.org/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UCL-RITS/rc-docs-content.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UCL-RITS/rc-docs-content)

## Possible things to do

- make a metrics layout for posts

- should known issues be posts?

- make a style guide (then tweak MDL options to fit)

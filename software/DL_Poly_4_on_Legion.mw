'''Current Version: 4.07'''<br />
A build of DL_Poly 4 is available to users on Legion. It has been built with the default modules environment (Intel compilers and QLogic MPI).

Please read and understand the DL_Poly 4 license when registering, as it restricts what you may do with the software.

Version 4.07 is available on Legion, but you are licensed for specific versions only. <br /><br />'''Useful Links:'''

* [http://www.stfc.ac.uk/SCD/research/app/ccg/software/DL_POLY/44516.aspx DL Poly 4 web page] 
* [http://www.stfc.ac.uk/SCD/research/app/ccg/software/DL_POLY/40526.aspx Registering for DL Poly 4]   <br /><br />
==Setup==
<br />'''In order to use the central builds of DL_Poly 4, you will need to be added to the appropriate UNIX user group. Please forward your registration confirmation e-mail to [mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk rc-support@ucl.ac.uk] to be added to the group.'''

DL_Poly looks for its input files in the directory which its executable has been placed. Since this is not practical in a multi-user environment, it is necessary for a user to copy the DL_Poly executable to their working directory before running it. The script below does this as part of the job, as well as creating a job-specific working directory. In addition, many of the scripts provided with the DL_Poly distribution that live in the execute subdirectory have had the execute bit removed so that they cannot run (they would not work anyway as users do not have permission to write to this directory).

Note: for other versions of DL_POLY, modify <tt>dl_poly_executable</tt> appropriately. You can use <tt>module show</tt> to get information about the different versions.

# Batch script to run an MPI DL_POLY job on Legion with the upgraded 
# software stack under SGE. Updated Oct 2015.

# 1. Force bash as the executing shell.
#$ -S /bin/bash

# 2. Request thirty minutes of wallclock time (format hours:minutes:seconds).
#$ -l h_rt=0:30:0

# 3. Request 1 gigabyte of RAM.
#$ -l mem=1G

# 4. Set the name of the job.
#$ -N DL_POLY

# 5. Select the MPI parallel environment and 16 processors.
#$ -pe mpi 16

# 7. Set the working directory to somewhere in your scratch space.  This 
# is a necessary step with the upgraded software stack as compute nodes 
# cannot write to $HOME.  This should be set to the directory where 
# your DL_Poly input files are.
#$ -wd /home/<your username>/Scratch/output/

# 8. Now we need to set up and run our DL_Poly job.  DL_Poly is a bit 
# odd, so we need to move files about to make things run.

You will need to modify the contents of section 7 so that it points to the directory with your input files in it. This script will create a sub-directory of that directory called <jobname>_<job id> with your data and output in it.

More advanced users may wish to create their own scripts and work-flows around the DL_POLY binary. Do a <code>module show</code> on the DL_POLY module version you wish to use to see the location of the execute directory.

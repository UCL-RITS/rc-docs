=Reporting a problem with an RC Systems service=
RC Systems' support process is based around a ticketing system. To submit a ticket please send an e-mail to [mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk rc-support@ucl.ac.uk].

In order to help our support team deal with your ticket efficiently, please ensure the following is the case:

# You have a clear description of your problem. This should include:
#* Which system you are using (Legion, Grace, Aristotle etc).
#* What you were doing when you got the error.
#* What the error was (including a copy of the exact error message on the email body or a relevant extract).
#* Job IDs, job scripts and job output/error files if relevant.
# Please avoid creating duplicate tickets. If you are following up on an existing problem, please reply to a response from the ticketing system (or at least a message with the ticket ID in the subject) for the original ticket. This way our support staff will be able to see a complete history of your problem, and it is considerably more likely that your issue will be dealt with by a member of staff who is familiar with the history of your problem.

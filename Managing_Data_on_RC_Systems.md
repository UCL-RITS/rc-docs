This section contains information about storage hierarchy in RC systems and the ways in which you can move data in and out of them.

These services should not be used to store data for which you have obligations under the UK Data Protection Act 1998. For further information and advice, please see:

[http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide]

=Managing data on RC systems=

At some point, you are going to need to copy input files on to our systems and copy your results back to your local machine or to a backup elsewhere. (It is good practice to always make your own backups). First we give generic instructions for doing so - do also check the machine-specific information on this page for details about things like dedicated transfer nodes, different file storage areas and quotas.

=Copying files using Linux or Mac OS X=

You can use the command-line utilities scp, sftp or rsync to copy your data about.

===scp===

This will copy a data file from somewhere on your local machine to a specified location on the remote machine.
<code>
 scp <local_data_file> <remote_user_id>@<remote_hostname>:<remote_path>
</code>

This will do the reverse, copying from the remote machine to your local machine. (Run from your local machine).

<code>
 scp <remote_user_id>@<remote_hostname>:<remote_path><remote_data_file> <local_path>
</code>

===sftp===

You can use sftp to log in to the remote machine, navigate through directories and use put and get to copy files from and to your local machine. <code>lcd</code> and <code>lls</code> are local equivalents of <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> so you can navigate through your local directories as you go.

<code>
 sftp <remote_user_id>@<remote_hostname>
 cd <remote_path>
 get <remote_file>
 lcd <local_path>
 put <local_file>
</code>

===rsync===

Rsync is used to remotely synchronise directories, so can be used to only copy files which have changed. Have a look at the man pages as there are many options.

=Copying files using Windows and WinSCP=

WinSCP is a graphical client that you can use for scp or sftp.

# The login/create new session screen will open if this is the first time you are using WinSCP.
# You can choose SFTP or SCP as the file protocol. If you have an unstable connection with one, you may wish to try the other. SCP is probably generally better.
# Fill in the hostname of the machine you wish to connect to, your username and password.
# Click Save and give your settings a useful name.
# You'll then be shown your list of Stored sessions, which will have the one you just created.
# Select the session and click Login.

=Transferring files from outside the UCL firewall=

To transfer files when you are outside UCL's network, you can use the [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/network/vpn IS VPN], which will allow you to ssh directly into Legion or login05 as if you were inside the network, without having to go via Socrates first.

If not using the VPN, you will need to do some form of ssh tunnelling - read on.

==Single-step login on Linux or Mac OS X using tunnelling==

Inside your ~/.ssh directory on your local machine, add the below to your config file (or create a file called config if you don't already have one).

Generically, it should be of this form where <code><name></code> can be anything you want to call this entry.

<code>
 Host <name>
    User <your.username>
    HostName <full.hostname>
    proxyCommand ssh -W <full.hostname>:22 <your.username>@socrates.ucl.ac.uk
</code>

Here are some examples - you can have as many of these as you need in your config file.

<code>
 Host legion
    User <your.username>
    HostName legion.rc.ucl.ac.uk
    proxyCommand ssh -W legion.rc.ucl.ac.uk:22 <your.username>@socrates.ucl.ac.uk

 Host login05
    User <your.username>
    HostName login05.external.legion.ucl.ac.uk
    proxyCommand ssh -W login05.external.legion.ucl.ac.uk:22 <your.username>@socrates.ucl.ac.uk

 Host aristotle
    User <your.username>
    HostName aristotle.rc.ucl.ac.uk
    proxyCommand ssh -W aristotle.rc.ucl.ac.uk:22 <your.username>@socrates.ucl.ac.uk
</code>

You can now just do <code>ssh legion</code> or <code>scp aristotle</code> and you will go through Socrates. You'll be asked for login details twice since you're logging in to two machines. (Socrates uses central UCL credentials).

==Single-step login on Windows using tunnelling==

WinSCP can also set up SSH tunnels.

# Create a new session as before, and tick the ''Advanced options'' box in the bottom left corner. 
# Select ''Connection > Tunnel'' from the left pane.
# Tick the ''Connect through SSH tunnel'' box and enter the hostname of the gateway you are tunnelling through, for example <code>socrates.ucl.ac.uk</code>
# Fill in your username and password for that host. (Central UCL ones for Socrates).
# Select ''Session'' from the left pane and fill in the hostname you want to end up on after the tunnel.
# Fill in your username and password for that host and set the file protocol to SCP.
# Save your settings with a useful name.

=Managing your quota=

To check your quota, run the command <code>lquota</code>. (Note: not currently available on new Legion - see below). Also useful is <code>du</code>, giving you information about your disk usage. For example, <code>du -ch <dir></code> will give you a summary of the sizes of directory tree and subtrees, in human-readable sizes, with a total at the bottom. <code>du -h --max-depth=1</code> will show you the totals for all top-level directories relative to where you are, plus the grand total. These can help you track down the locations of large amounts of data if you need to reduce your disk usage.

To check your quota on Legion, please run <code>quota_check</code>. This is part of the <code>userscripts/1.1.0</code> module which is now loaded by default. We are not currently automatically enforcing quotas on Lustre on Legion, but we have enabled checks on log in again. We will email users who are over quota and may stop you submitting jobs if you do not reduce your usage.

Please contact [mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk rc-support@ucl.ac.uk] for more information.

=Accessing Research Data Storage=

To access data stored in Research Data Storage, you can use scp to transfer data to/from the RC Services machine.
Here is a guide on [[Connecting to Research Data Services]].

=Legion-specific information=

To transfer your data to and from Legion in the most efficient manner, you must have a basic understanding of the bandwidth limitations of the machine.

The entire system is limited by a 10Gb ethernet connection to UCL's network. If you find a significantly lower throughput, this may be caused by a bottleneck along the path between Legion and the machine you are trying to send the data to/from.

Login and compute nodes are individually connected to the network via 1Gb/s links. This means that the maximum theoretical throughput that you can expect from any node in Legion is 125MB/s. Taking into account protocol overheads, you should see a maximum throughput of around 100MB/s on each node.

For this reason we have to make the distinction between transferring large and modest amounts of data. 

==Transferring modest amounts of data==
 
You can use Legion's login nodes to transfer modest amounts of data.

Please bear in mind that there is no limit on the number of users that can be logged in to the Login nodes. Their activity may cause your data transfer rates to drop (as yours may affect theirs). If you need to transfer large amounts of data or need more reliable transfer rates, we recommend that you do so within a batch job, as described in the following section. 

If you are running scp from your local machine, use <code>legion.rc.ucl.ac.uk</code> as the hostname and you will transfer via the login nodes.

==Dedicated transfer node==

Legion provides a dedicated transfer node with ten gigabit network connections to the UCL network and to Legion. To access this node, log in via scp, sftp or ssh to:

<code>
 login05.external.legion.ucl.ac.uk
</code>

Please note that you cannot submit or view the status of your compute jobs on this node - it is only available for data transfer.

==Legion's storage architecture and hierarchy==

Legion has three types of storage with distinct levels of performance, volatility and reliability:

===Home directories ($HOME)===

* Smaller amount of storage
* Backed up
* Read-only access from compute nodes

This storage has currently a hard quota of 50GB per user. It is the most reliable. But due to contention between several users it has very high performance variability. You can read and write to it from the login nodes, but only read access is granted from the compute nodes. The rationale for this stems from the fact that it cannot withstand large amounts of Input/Output such as that which happens within a large cluster like Legion. This is also to make sure that only important data is backed up as otherwise there would be excessive load on the backup system both in terms of performance and capacity.

===Shared scratch area ($HOME/Scratch)===

* Larger storage
* Not backed up
* Writable by compute nodes

$HOME/Scratch is a symbolic link to the Lustre file system attached to Legion. This storage has very high throughput on individual files and allows separate processes on different machines to open the same file for I/O simultaneously. Due to its complexity, it performs very poorly when handling large amounts of small files. For example, running the “find” command on a directory within $HOME/Scratch has much poorer performance than running in a directory stored under $HOME. Again, due to its complexity, it is prone to failure and may have to be completely reformatted if file system errors build up. Therefore, we give no guarantee that data stored on this file system is safe and strongly recommend that you save any important data as soon as possible to your $HOME directory via login nodes or any other external backup storage.

Scratch and its underlying hardware are of vital importance for the good operation of the cluster in terms of I/O performance. Because this resource is scarce, the [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/about/governance/research-it/crag CRAG] has enforced usage quotas, to be reviewed monthly. The use of Scratch is now subject to the following policies:

* All users will be granted an initial Scratch quota. Users are free to work within this quota but should note that files stored in their Scratch directory are NOT backed up and should therefore be considered ‘at risk’.

* Users may request increases in their Scratch quota by [https://wiki.rc.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/Legion_Priority_Access submitting a form] to [mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk rc-support@ucl.ac.uk]. They will be required to explain why they need an increase from a technical and computational point of view.

* The Scratch quota will be implemented as a soft quota so users will be able to temporarily exceed their quota for a short period. This period is set to 14 days by default.

* When a user exceeds their Scratch quota a warning is added to their Legion Message of the Day (MOTD) and an email is sent to their UCL email address. The warnings will display how much they are over quota, how long they have to reduce their usage and what will happen if they fail to reduce their usage.

* While a user continues to use more than their Scratch quota subsequent warning emails will be sent by the system every day.

* If a user reduces their usage of Scratch to below their quota within the 14 day grace period, no further action will be taken.

* At the end of the 14 day grace period if a user hasn't reduced their Scratch usage to below their quota, the system will stop the user from submitting any jobs until their Scratch usage is below their quota.

* In addition to user Scratch quotas there will be an overall limit on Lustre usage of 75% of total space, in order to ensure performance is maintained. If this limit is exceeded, ALL Legion users will be informed by email to their UCL email address of the risk to Lustre and requested to delete or move unwanted or currently unused files.

===Local node scratch area ($TMPDIR)===

* Only exists during your job
* Fastest access as is local

This storage resides on the hard drive installed in the compute nodes. It is only accessible temporarily throughout the duration of the job you have submitted and only within each of the compute nodes assigned to you. The path to this storage is set at run time in the $TMPDIR environment variable. This variable is set only within a shell generated by the SGE scheduler, and the path therein is unique to the node and job you are running. Once your job has completed the $TMPDIR directory is deleted on each node, so make sure that you have given enough wall clock time to allow data to be transferred back to your scratch area. Note that in parallel jobs running N slots (processes) only the main node ( slot 1 ) can be scripted as the remaining N-1 ones are just used to run compute processes without shell interaction - this means that your parallel program should only write to this local storage on process 1 (or 0, depending on the programming language).   Users may automate the transfer of data from $TMPDIR to their scratch area by adding the directive <code>#Local2Scratch</code> to their job script.

The amount of space available in $TMPDIR is controlled on a per node basis by the <code>#$ -l tmpfs</code> grid engine directive. This is to stop jobs interfering with each other by running out of disk space.  If this directive is omitted from job scripts, then a default of 10 Gigabytes per node will be allocated to the job. For example to request 15 GB include:
<code>
 #$ -l tmpfs=15G
</code>
in the job script.

The following diagram illustrates how these various levels of storage relate to login and compute nodes:

==Transferring files to or from Legion using a batch job==

''Note: we recommend using the dedicated transfer node, as explained above, to perform large transfers. This method should only be used if the transfer node is unavailable for some reason.''

Using a batch job you can transfer multiple files or sections of a file simultaneously via each compute node directly onto Lustre, maximising the use of 10Gb/s link that connects Legion to the UCL network.

You can use the scp or sftp commands on Legion to do file transfers between Legion and some remote machine of your choice, but both of these commands need to log in to the remote machine, and they need to do this WITHOUT any need for interactive input, i.e. without needing you to supply a password.

The recommended method of doing this is to use RSA based authentication, i.e. using an SSH public/private key pair, generated by (for example) the Unix command ssh-keygen.

===Setting up the necessary Authentication Keys===

If you already have such a key pair for other purposes (e.g. for password-less login to Legion from your desktop machine), then all you need to do is to copy the private key file id_rsa into the .ssh directory in your Legion home directory (making sure that it is readable only by you), and also copy the contents of the public key file id_rsa.pub into the file

authorized_keys

in the .ssh directory on your remote machine.

If you haven't generated an SSH key pair before, simply run this command on Legion:
<code>
 ssh-keygen -t rsa
</code>
pressing return when it asks for passphrase. This will generate the key pair in the following two files in the directory .ssh in your Legion home directory:

id_rsa (the private key)

and

id_rsa.pub (the public key)

Finally, you need to copy the contents of the public key id_rsa.pub into the file authorized_keys (creating it first if necessary), in the .ssh directory under your home directory on your remote machine.

Note that, in general, the private key is in the .ssh directory of the machine you are making the SSH connection FROM, and the public key is in the .ssh of the machine you are connecting TO. You may well wish to connect between your remote machine and Legion in BOTH directions, e.g. to both SSH into Legion, and to allow Legion to do an scp/sftp file transfer to your remote machine: in this case you will have both public and private keys in the .ssh directories on both machines, thus allowing password-less connection in both directions.

In the above description it is assumed that you are using a remote Unix machine; this method also works with a remote Windows machine, though the location of the .ssh directory is different, and may depend on your version of Windows.

===Using SCP or SFTP without interactive input in a batch job===

Having set up the SSH keys as described above, you can now use scp or sftp to do file transfer within a batch job. For instance, you could use an scp command like this:
<code>
 scp my_results \
 <my_remote_userid>@<my_remote_hostname>:legion_files/my_results
</code>
This will copy your Legion file my_results into a file of the same name in the directory legion_files on your remote machine <my_remote_hostname>. Note that the directory legion_files must already exist.

Similarly, you could copy a data file from legion_files on your remote machine to Legion, but with one caviat - your $HOME directory in Legion is read-only, as viewed by the worker nodes! You must therefore copy your data to $HOME/Scratch:
<code>
 scp <my_remote_userid>@<my_remote_hostname>:legion_files/my_results \
 $HOME/Scratch/my_results
</code>
Either of these commands should be embedded in a simple job script like the one in the example below, which should be submitted using qsub (remember to supply your correct consortium and project for the job):
<code>
 #!/bin/bash -l
 #$ -N Data_transfer
 #$ -l h_rt=1:0:0
 #$ -l mem=1G
 #$ -P <your_project_name>
 #$ -wd /home/<your_user_id>/Scratch
 <scp_command>
</code>
You can also use sftp to do a similar job, though in this case the situation is complicated by the fact that sftp normally takes its commands interactively.

To get round this, supply the sftp commands with a file called sftp_script in your Legion home directory, like this:
<code>
 cd legion_files
 put my_results
 exit
</code>
and then supply this script name to the sftp command using the -b option, like this:
<code>
 sftp -b sftp_script <my_remote_userid>@<my_remote_hostname>
</code>
This command will perform the same transfer as the first scp example above, and should be submitted as a batch job using a similar job script to the one shown.

As usual, please contact research-computing@ucl.ac.uk if you need any assistance with doing this.

=Iridis-Specific Information=

The Iridis service was discontinued on 31 July 2015, and all the data it held in UCL user home directories was copied to Legion, into a read-only storage area only accessible from the Legion transfer node, login05:
<code>
 /imports/iridis/<username>
</code>
This data was kept available until 18th April 2016.

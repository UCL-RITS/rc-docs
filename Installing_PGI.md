== PGI Compiler Suite Installation at UCL ==

UCL has two floating licences for PGI Fortran/C/C++ Server for Linux. Purchased primarily for building Gaussian 03 and Gaussian 09 on UCL computers. To install follow the procedure below. If you are installing on a system outside the Institutional Firewall, please connect to the [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/get-connected/remote-working/vpn UCL VPN service] first.

* Download version 13.9 or 11.9 from the [http://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/ UCL Software Database] on your Linux system in a empty directory. You will need to login with your UCL userid and password.
*      Untar the installer files using:<br />
         tar xvzf pgilinux-2013-139.tar.gz
*      Run the installer as root and follow the instructions:
         ./install
* During the installation you will be asked: ''Do you wish to generate license keys? (y/n)'' - Enter ''n'' as you will need to use the central UCL licence server.

* Add the PGI Suite bin directory to your PATH. The default location used by the installer is ''/opt/pgi/linux86-64/13.9/bin''.
* Open access to TCP ports 27000 and 27055 in your local firewall and any departmental firewall.
* Setup access to the licence server by setting the LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable. Use either:
         export LM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@lic-pgi.ucl.ac.uk

         export LM_LICENSE_FILE=$LM_LICENSE_FILE:27000@lic-pgi.ucl.ac.uk
* Use the second version if you have other licence managers already defined.

The PGI compilers should now be installed and working.

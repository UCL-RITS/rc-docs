We now have a single simplified application process for all of our research computing platforms.

To obtain an account, you must either be, or be approved by, a permanent member of staff. If you are a student or a postdoctoral researcher, this will normally be your supervisor. You will need your UCL userid and password to access the application form.

Follow the link below to access the account services page to apply for an account:

The '''[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/research-it/research-data/ Research Data Services]''' group (RDS) run a number of systems designed to help with data storage during and after a project. Several solutions for copying data between RDS and each of the central UCL research computing platforms are presented below. Sections of the example code surrounded by angle brackets (<>) should be replaced by the information indicated (do not keep the angle brackets in).

==Between Legion and RDS==
If you already have an account with Research Data Services, you can transfer data directly between Legion and Research Data Storage using the Secure Copy (<code>scp</code>) command.

=== From RDS to Legion ===
If you are on a research data login node, you can transfer data to Legionâ€™s Scratch area at the highest rate currently possible by running the command:
<code>
 scp data_file.tgz login05.external.legion.ucl.ac.uk:~/Scratch/
</code>
Or from somewhere within Legion (including compute nodes in running jobs) running the command:
<code>
 scp ssh.rd.ucl.ac.uk:~/data_file.tgz ~/Scratch/
</code>

=== From Legion to RDS ===
From Legion, send data to your project space on RDS by running the command:
<code>
 scp data_file.tgz <user_name>@ssh.rd.ucl.ac.uk:<path_to_project_space>
</code>

==Between RDS and Emerald==

=== From Emerald to RDS ===

[[Category:Pages with bash scripts]]

Add the following to a file named ''~/.ssh/config'' on Emerald:
<div style="background-color:#F9F9F9;width=100%;padding:5px 10px 5px 10px;"><code>
 <nowiki>
ForwardAgent yes
ForwardX11 yes

Host rds
Hostname ssh.rd.ucl.ac.uk
User <user name>
ProxyCommand ssh <user name>@socrates.ucl.ac.uk -W %h:%p
</nowiki>
</code>
</div>

Where ''<user name>'' is your UCL user name. Once this is done use scp in the usual way to copy files directly from Emerald to RDS; e.g.:
<code>
 scp data_file.tgz rds:<path_to_project_space>
</code>



=== From RDS to Emerald ===
Connections from RDS to Emerald do not have to go via a gateway, although access to Emerald is via ssh-key authentication only so it is necessary to set this up before copying data from RDS to Emerald. Once this is done, use scp in the usual way; e.g.:
<code>
 scp data_file.tgz <user_name>@emerald.einfrastructuresouth.ac.uk:<target_path>
</code>
Where ''<user_name>'' is your Emerald user name.

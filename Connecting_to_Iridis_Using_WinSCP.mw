You will need:

* An Iridis account
* WinSCP
* A private key previously generated by PuTTYgen (PuTTYgen is included with WinSCP)
* A corresponding public key, which has been added to your account on Iridis


First, find and run WinSCP from the Start Menu.

[[File:Start-menu-winscp.png]]

When you first open up WinSCP, it'll ask you for some connection details. If you've used WinSCP before, you may get a list of connectable sessions. If so, click the button to create a new session setting.

You should see this:

[[File:Winscp-session-empty.png]]

Check the ''Advanced options'' checkbox in the bottom-left corner, and more options should appear. Select the ''Connection'' -> ''Tunnel'' option. We're creating a tunnel through the `eisgate` machine, to one of the Iridis login nodes, so check the "Connect through SSH tunnel" checkbox, and enter the host name as `eisgate.soton.ac.uk`. The user name should be your Iridis username, something like eisuc000. The private key file set should be the full location (i.e. `C:\Users\...a.ppk`) of the *filename*.ppk private key file saved from PuTTYgen -- click the "..." button to find it. Don't set a password here -- you will be asked for the password for your private key when connecting, and you can't save that password.

You should have something that looks like this:

Now select the ''Session'' option. This information will all be the same except for the host name, which should be one of the Iridis login nodes: `iridis3_a.soton.ac.uk`, `iridis3_b.soton.ac.uk`, or `iridis3_c.soton.ac.uk`, and the File protocol option, which should be "SCP".

It should now look something like this:

[[File:Winscp-session-filled.png]]

Click the Save button so you don't have to enter all this again next time, and give it a helpful label so you'll remember which settings you're using.

You'll then get the list of "Stored sessions" you have, which should include the one you've just created. Select it, and click "Login".

A generic "Don't hack us" warning should pop up -- click "Continue" and it'll get on with connecting.

A window showing your connection progress will pop up, and it'll ask you for your key's password twice -- once to connect to `eisgate` to create the tunnel, and once to connect to the Iridis login node.

[[File:Winscp-connecting-password-prompt-1.png]]

[[File:Winscp-connecting-password-prompt-2.png]]

It will also warn you both times that it doesn't recognise the server's host key -- this is because it hasn't connected to the server before, and if you were paranoid, you could check this against the server's key to check that your connection hadn't been hijacked. Since (I'm going to assume) you're not, just click "Yes" both times.

[[File:Warning-host-key.png]]

Assuming you've done all of this correctly, you should connect and get a screen like the one below, which will let you drag files back and forth between your local file system (left), and the remote system (right).

If that's all working, you're sorted.

A cost-effective option for research projects that involve a significant amount of computing, for a long duration, is to purchase dedicated hardware in the form of a Legion ‘Section’.

=What is a Legion Section?=

A Legion Section is a dedicated part of the Legion cluster to which nominated  users have near immediate access. The characteristics of the computing hardware will typically match those already existing (or planned) within the  Legion service, but it is also possible to add specialised computing technologies to meet specific research requirements.

A Legion Section allows researchers to obtain the ‘on demand’ benefits of purchasing their own cluster, without the overhead of procuring, hosting, and managing local machines. Jobs submitted to this resource will be always get priority access to the purchased nodes, whilst still benefiting from Legion’s shared storage, job submission system and software stack with central data centre hosting.

=How do I get access?=

A Legion Section can be purchased using direct funding; for example, research grant funding allocated to the purchase of computing resources. It may also be possible to obtain dedicated access to existing nodes for shorter periods of time via a leasing agreement. 

=What are the benefits of purchasing a Legion Section?=

These include:

* '''Increasing predictability of work''': one of the frustrations of a popular,  shared facility such as Legion is that job wait times experienced by users can vary greatly depending on the volume and types of jobs submitted at any given time. Although usage patterns are monitored closely by the CRAG, some 'peaks and troughs' in demand - and hence user experience - are unavoidable. Purchasing a Legion Section, PI's can obtain near on-demand access to compute resources when they need them, for nominated users.  
* '''Free up valuable and specialist local staff''': instead of hosting and managing local computing resources, researchers and specialist local IT staff are freed up to spend more time providing domain-specific support that delivers additional value to group projects. 
*'''Reduce environmental impact''': by purchasing hardware that will be hosted in one of UCL's main data centres, environmental impact is reduced and valuable estates space is released. 
* '''Professional systems administration services''' to operate and manage your hardware within a resilient infrastructure are provided at no cost.
* '''Specialist user and applications support services''' to help you get the most out of your hardware, also provided at no cost. 
* '''Storage included''': access to Legion's storage infrastructure at no additional cost: purchased hardware will mount Legion's /scratch and /home areas.
* A '''comprehensive software stack''' that works: over the past 8 years, we have built a software stack that covers the needs of almost all research fields across UCL – everything from development tools to commercial and open source research applications, perfectly integrated with the hardware we provide and with no vendor lock-in. 
* '''Interactive use of computing resources on-demand''': for testing and visualisation. We are happy to discuss how this can be achieved using your Legion section.
* An '''all-inclusive service wrap''' at no additional cost, including highly-rated expert service support, data centre space, power and cooling.
* '''Immediate access''' to computing resources if required: if timescales are short, we will re-purpose existing equivalent Legion hardware to bridge the gap before the new hardware arrives.
* '''No change in access rights to 'standard' Legion compute nodes''': nominated users of your Legion Section will still be able to make full use of 'standard' Legion nodes, with jobs targeted at the Legion Section 'bursting' onto standard nodes as needed.

=Can we install our own software?=

Yes, there are a number of ways in which we make this possible. As a matter of course, all Legion users are free to install software in their own home directories if they wish; however, the research computing platforms team are here to help as much as possible with getting software installed centrally on Legion where it can be used by everyone. We are also happy to work with local IT staff to help them install and manage packages on behalf of their departments.

=How much does a Legion section cost?=
We don't have a standard price for Legion hardware as manufacturers' list prices fluctuate quite a bit and the discount also varies with the size of the hardware procurement. The price will depend upon the number and type of nodes you require as well as the networking between these nodes.

We would recommend meeting in person to discuss your requirements so that we can obtain a proper quotation.

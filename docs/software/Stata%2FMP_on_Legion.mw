'''Current Version: 14'''<br />
Stata is a statistics, data management, and graphics system. Stata/MP is the version of the package that runs on multiple cores.

A sixteen user licence of Stata/MP, the multicore version of the Stata statistics, data management, and graphics system is installed on Legion. The licence we have supports Stata running on up to four cores per job.

Stata is intended to be run primarily within batch jobs however you may short (less than 5 minutes execution time) interactive tests on the Login Nodes and longer tests on the Usertest Nodes. <br /><br />
==Setup==
The following changes need to be made to the standard Legion modules before running this software:<br />

<code>module load stata/14</code><br /><br />You can check that the module is loaded using:
<code>
 module list
</code>
You should now be able to use Stata interactively using either:
<code>
 stata-mp
</code>
for a command line interface or:
<code>
 xstata-mp
</code>
for the GUI interface. Note: this version requires an X server running on your local computer.
==Example Job Submission Script==
To submit batch jobs to the cluster you will need a runscript. Here is a simple example Stata runscript including comments:
<div style="background-color:#F9F9F9;width=100%;padding:5px 10px 5px 10px;">
<code>
 <nowiki>
#!/bin/bash -l

# Batch script to run a Stata/MP job on Legion with the upgraded
# software stack under SGE.
#
# Updated Oct 2015
#
# Based on openmp.sh by:
#
# Owain Kenway, Research Computing, 16/Sept/2010

#$ -S /bin/bash

# 1. Request 12 hours of wallclock time (format hours:minutes:seconds).
#$ -l h_rt=12:0:0

# 2. Request 1 gigabyte of RAM per core.
#$ -l mem=1G

# 3. Set the name of the job.
#$ -N Stata_job1

# 4. Select  4 OpenMP threads (the most possible with Stata/MP on Legion).
#$ -pe smp 4

# 6. Set the working directory to somewhere in your scratch space. This is
# a necessary step with the upgraded software stack as compute nodes cannot
# write to $HOME.
#
# Note: this directory MUST exist before your job starts!
#
# Replace "<your_UCL_id>" with your UCL user ID :)
#$ -wd /home/<your_UCL_id>/Scratch/Stata_output

# 7. Set up Stata/MP environment
#
# Your work must be done in $TMPDIR
cd $TMPDIR
module load stata/14

# 8. Run Stata do file
cp $dofile $TMPDIR
stata-mp -b do $dofile 

# 9. Preferably, tar-up (archive) all output files onto the shared scratch area

tar zcvf $HOME/Scratch/Stata_output/files_from_job_$JOB_ID.tar.gz $TMPDIR
</nowiki>
</code>
</div>
This is available on:
<code>
 /shared/ucl/apps/StataMP/share/run-stata-mp.sh
</code>
Please copy if you wish and edit it to suit your jobs. You will need to change the ''-wd /home/<your_UCL_id>/Scratch/Stata_output'' SGE directives and may need to change the number of threads, memory, wallclock time and job name directives as well. A suitable qsub command to submit a Stata job to process the do file ''myDofile.do'' located in your current directory would be:
<code>
 qsub -v dofile=`pwd`/myDofile run-stata-mp.sh
</code>
Output from this job will be written to a file called ''myDofile.log'' which will be saved in the tar archive ''files_from_job_$JOB_ID'' in your Scratch area.

The example runscript can be modified to submit 1000s of Stata jobs using the SGE Array job facility. See the [https://wiki.rc.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/Category:Legion_User_Guide RC Systems User Guide] for examples of array job runscripts.

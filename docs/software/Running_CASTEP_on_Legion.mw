CASTEP is a full-featured materials modelling code based on a first-principles quantum mechanical description of electrons and nuclei. Using density functional theory, it can simulate a wide range of properties of materials proprieties including energetics, structure at the atomic level, vibrational properties, electronic response properties etc. In particular it has a wide range of spectroscopic features that link directly to experiment, such as infra-red and Raman spectroscopies, NMR, and core level spectra. CASTEP is developed by members of the Castep Developers Group (CDG) who are currently all UK based academics.

Access to CASTEP is enabled by a module file and being a member of the appropriate reserved application group. Please email rc-support AT ucl.ac.uk to get your userid added to the CASTEP group.

On Legion CASTEP is intended to be run primarily within batch jobs however you may run short (less than 5 minutes execution time) interactive tests on the Login Nodes and longer interactive tests on the User Test Nodes.

To use CASTEP you need to load the following modules:
<code>
 module load chemistry-modules
 module load castep/6.0.1/openmpi/gnu.4.6.3/castep
 module load submission-scripts/submissionscripts
</code>
The final module adds the Chemistry submission scripts directory to your PATH. Included is a script called castep.submit to generate an appropriate runscript and submit a CASTEP job to the cluster. This script can be used interactively where it will prompt you for input files and parameters or by giving arguments on the command line. To use it interactively type:
<code>
 castep.submit
</code>
and respond to the prompts. To use it with command line arguments use a command line of the form:
<code>
 castep.submit input_name number_of_cores version wallclock_time memory jobname
</code>
where:

* ''input_name'' is the prefix of your input files. For example for input files  ''Si2.cell'' and ''Si2.param'' etc, your input_name is Si2.
* ''number_of_cores'' is the number of MPI processes needed for your job.
* ''version'' is the CASTEP version you want to use. Currently only 6.0.1 is available.
* ''wallclock_time'' is the expected elapsed job runtime in the form ''hours:minutes:seconds''.
* ''memory'' is the amount of RAM needed per process - ''1G'' for example.

Here is an example of using castep.submit with one of the tutorial examples:
<code>
 castep.submit Si2 4 6.0.1 0:45:0 1G myCastepJob
</code>
NOTE: you '''must''' run ''castep.submit'' from a subdirectory of your ~/Scratch directory. This is so the working directory of your job is on the Scratch filesystem. Output files from the job will be written to this directory.

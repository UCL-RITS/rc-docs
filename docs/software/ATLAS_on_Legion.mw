ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) provides self-tuning implementations of BLAS and LAPACK. We have versions of ATLAS available that were built with various different compilers.

==Linking ATLAS 3.10.2==

There are ATLAS modules for GCC 4.9.2 and the Intel 2015 compilers.

The modules add the relevant lib directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH. You can see what those are with <code>module show</code> followed by the module name.

===Dynamic linking===

There is one combined library each for serial and threaded ATLAS (in most circumstances you probably want the serial version). 

Serial:

<code>
 -L${ATLASROOT}/lib -lsatlas
</code> 

Threaded:

<code>
 -L${ATLASROOT}/lib -ltatlas
</code>

===Static linking===

There are multiple libraries.

Serial:

<code>
 -L${ATLASROOT}/lib -llapack -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas
</code>

Threaded:

<code>
 -L${ATLASROOT}/lib -llapack -lptf77blas -lptcblas -latlas
</code>

===Runtime errors===

If you get a runtime error saying that libgfortran.so cannot be found, you need to add <code>-lgfortran</code> to your link line. 

The Intel equivalent is <code>-lifcore</code>.

You can do a module show on the compiler you are using to see where the libraries are located.

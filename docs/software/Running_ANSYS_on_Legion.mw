=ANSYS on Legion=

ANSYS/CFX and ANSYS/Fluent version 14.5.7 are available on Legion. Before either application can be run, the user needs to go though a number of set up steps. These are detailed here.

The ANSYS module needs to be loaded by issuing the command:
<code>
 module load ansys/14.5.7
</code>
The first time this is done, users should run the shell script ''setup_cfx.sh'' to configure licensing and HP-MPI options on a login node:
<code>
 setup_cfx.sh 
</code>
Running this script is required regardless of whether you are running ANSYS/CFX or ANSYS/Fluent. 

ANSYS/CFX and ANSYS/Fluent are intended to be run primarily within batch jobs however you may run short (less than 5 minutes execution time) interactive tests on the Login Nodes and longer (up to two hours) on the User Test Nodes. Interactive work can be done using the ANSYS interactive tools provided you have X-windows functionality enabled though your ssh connection. See our [[Legion User Guide]] for more information about enabling X-windows functionality and the User Test nodes.

Our current licence allows up to ten ANSYS/CFX and ANSYS/Fluent jobs running at one time using no more than 64 cores in addition to cores on each job's head node.

=ANSYS/CFX Job Submission=

On Legion, there are a limited number of licenses (10 jobs, additional 64 cores) available for running CFX and Fluent jobs and in order to make sure that jobs only run if there are licenses available, it is necessary for users to request ANSYS licenses with their jobs, by adding "-ac app=cfx" to their job submission.  

In addition, because CFX handles its own parallelisation, a number of complex options need to be passed in job scripts to make it run correctly.  

===Single node run===

Here is an example runscript for running cfx5solve multi-threaded on a given .def file including comments.

<code>
 #!/bin/bash -l

 # ANSYS 14.5.7: Batch script to run cfx5solve on the StaticMixer.def example 
 # file, single node multi-threaded (4 threads),

 # 1. Force bash as the executing shell.

 #$ -S /bin/bash

 # 2. Request 15 munutes of wallclock time (format hours:minutes:seconds).
 #$ -l h_rt=0:15:0

 # 3. Request 1 gigabyte of RAM.
 #$ -l mem=1G

 # 4. Set the name of the job.
 #$ -N StaticMixer_thread_4

 # 5. Select 4 threads.
 #$ -l thr=4

 # 6. Select the project that this job will run under.
 #$ -P <your project name>

 # 7. Request ANSYS licences 
 #$ -ac app=cfx

 # 8. Set the working directory to somewhere in your scratch space. In this
 # case the subdirectory cfxtests-14.5.7
 #$ -wd /home/<your userid>/Scratch/cfxtests-14.5.7

 # 9. Load the ANSYS module to set up your environment

 module load ansys/14.5.7

 # 10. Copy the .def file into the working (current) directory

 cp /home/<your userid>/cfx_examples/StaticMixer.def .

 # 11. Run cfx5solve - Note: -max-elapsed-time needs to be set to the same
 # time as defined by 2 above.

 cfx5solve -max-elapsed-time "15 [min]" -def StaticMixer.def -par-local -partition $OMP_NUM_THREADS

This runscript is available on Legion in the file:
<code>
 /shared/ucl/apps/ansys/14.5.7/ucl/share/run-StaticMixer-thr.sh
</code>
Please copy if you wish and edit it to suit your jobs. You will need to change the ''-P <your_project_name>''  and ''-wd /home/<your_UCL_id>/Scratch/cfxtests-14.5.7''  SGE directives and may need to change the memory, wallclock time, number of threads and job name directives as well. Replace the ''.def'' file in 10 and 11 by your one and modify the ''-max-elapsed-time'' value if needed. The simplest form of qsub command can be used to submit the job eg:
<code>
 qsub run-StaticMixer-thr.sh
</code>
Output files will be saved in the job's working directory.

===Multi node run===

Here is an example runscript for running cfx5solve on more than one node (using MPI) on a given .def file including comments.

 export CFX_NODES=`cfxnodes $TMPDIR/machines`

 # 12. Force infinipath

'''Current Version: 1.0.6, 1.2.2'''<br />
There is a centrally provided install of CESM on Legion, provided through the modules system. In order to use this install, you need to register for an account with the CESM developers (so that you can accept the license and use SVN to access data sets) and notify [mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk rc-support@ucl.ac.uk] that you wish to be added to the CESM Unix group (legcesm). <br /><br />'''Useful Links:'''

==Setup==
In order to use the install of CESM on Legion, you need to have a Legion account, have registered with the CESM developers (for access to SVN) and send an e-mail to [mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk rc-support@ucl.ac.uk] asking to be added to the CESM Unix group (legcesm). <br /> <br />The following changes need to be made to the standard modules before running this software: <br />

<code>module load hdf/5-1.8.15/intel-2015-update2</code><br /><code>module load perl/5.16.0</code><br /><code>module load cesm/1.2.2/intel-2015-update2</code><br /><br />&nbsp;
===Before first use===

Before you use CESM, you need to run an initial config script (you don't need to run this again) and set an environment variable so that CESM knows what project to auto-generate job scripts for.

First, make sure you don't have a ~/Scratch/cesm directory (and move it if you do) and then run:
<code>
 legion_cesm_setup.sh
</code>
This will create the following directory structure:

<code>
Scratch/cesm
  &#124; 
  +-- archive
  +-- cases
  +-- inputdata
  +-- output
  +-- scratch
</code>
These should be self-explanatory, except that "output" is used for storing SGE log files.

===Check that everything is set up properly===

It's worth doing a simple test to make sure that everything is working.  To create and run a simple test case (note these files still have "legion" in the name even on Grace):
<code>
 cd ~/Scratch/cesm/cases
 create_newcase -case legiontest -res f19_g16 -compset X -mach legion
</code>
If this succeeds, you should have a "legiontest" CESM case within your cases folder.
<code>
 cd legiontest
 ./cesm_setup
</code>
After you have completed this step, take a quick look at legiontest.legion.run to make sure that the run script has your project and other settings set correctly.

Then you can build the case:
<code>
 ./legiontest.build
</code>
And submit it:
<code>
 qsub legiontest.run
</code>

===Modifying CESM===

To use user-modified code in CESM, you can use the SourceMods directory within your new case, as described here:

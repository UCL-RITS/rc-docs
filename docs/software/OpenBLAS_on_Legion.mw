OpenBLAS provides CBLAS, BLAS and LAPACK.

There are versions compiled for the Intel and GNU compilers.

With the default modules loaded:
<code> 
 module load openblas/0.2.14/intel-2015-update2
</code>

<code>module show</code> on the OpenBLAS module will display that <code>$OPENBLASROOT</code> is set, so you can use this in your link line if the library is not picked up automatically. 

=Linking OpenBLAS=

* Our OpenBLAS modules now contain symlinks for libblas and liblapack that both point to libopenblas. This means that the default <code>-lblas -llapack</code> will in fact work.

This is how you would normally link OpenBLAS:

<code>
 -L${OPENBLASROOT}/lib -lopenblas
</code>

If code you are compiling requires separate entries for BLAS and LAPACK, set them both to <code>-lopenblas</code>.

=OpenBLAS and OpenMP warning=

If you are running a threaded program and get this warning:

<code>
 OpenBLAS Warning : Detect OpenMP Loop and this application may hang. Please rebuild the library with USE_OPENMP=1 option.
</code>

Then tell OpenBLAS to use only one thread by adding this to your jobscript (this overrides $OMP_NUM_THREADS for OpenBLAS):

<code>
 export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
</code>

If it is your code, you can also set it with the function
<code>
 void openblas_set_num_threads(int num_threads);
</code>

# Requesting Additional Resources

We recognise that researchers may sometimes require a higher throughput of work than it is possible to achieve with free ‘fair share’ usage of Legion. There a couple of ways of obtaining additional Legion resource beyond this fair share:

## Make a special request to the CRAG for free priority access

Users who wish to request additional resources or reserve resources beyond those provided can complete the additional resource request form in collaboration with your supervisor or the project's principal investigator.

The completed form should be sent to the Research Computing Platforms team at <rc-support@ucl.ac.uk>, for technical review. If successful, your case will be presented to the [CRAG](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/about/governance/research-it/crag) for consideration at the next meeting of the Group. The [CRAG](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/about/governance/research-it/crag) meets monthly, usually on the third Friday of the month, and users will be informed of the Group’s decision as soon as possible after their next meeting.

Note that an application to the [CRAG](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/about/governance/research-it/crag) for additional resources is only likely to be approved if the impact on other users is not deemed to be significant, or of long duration.

## Purchase dedicated compute nodes within Legion

A cost-effective option for research projects that involve a significant amount of computing, for a long duration, are able to purchase dedicated hardware in the form of a [Legion Section](Legion Section "wikilink"). A Legion Section allows researchers to obtain the ‘on demand’ benefits of purchasing their own cluster, without the overhead of procuring, hosting, and managing local machines. Jobs submitted to this resource will be always get priority access to the purchased nodes, whilst still benefiting from Legion’s shared storage, job submission system and software stack in a central data centre hosting.
